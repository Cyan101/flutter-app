# flutter-apps
Flutter apps (Mostly guides followed)

[Flutter](flutter.io) is a framework for developing cross platform applications
for Android and iOS Devices using a single simple framework built in Dart

This repo is just a collection of applications i've built using flutter and are mostly from guides (and as such are not my own unless otherwise stated)
Any changes made are just for playing around and I don't intend to claim these apps or variations (unless otherwise stated) as my own work.
